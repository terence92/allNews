Just a few days earlier, his wife, Brandy, had tested positive for coronavirus , but there wasn't much to it.\n\nAll she had was a really low-grade temperature, one that the doctors didn't even really consider to be a fever, she said. She had some congestion, but she was on the mend. He wasn't all that worried, either, when he started feeling unwell. After all, they were both young and healthy.\n\nThe two worked in the Cliffside Park School District in New Jersey, both as special education teachers -- she at School #4, he at School #6. A star baseball player in high school, he continued his passion by coaching the varsity baseball team.\n\nFor Ben, however, his symptoms quickly became more severe. He had more shortness of breath, and by the last Friday in March, he told Brandy it was time to go to the emergency room. \"He was really concerned,\" Brandy says. \"He came into our bedroom where I was laying, and he said, you know, I've got to go, I've got to take myself to the hospital.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you want to go there?\" she asked him. He said \"Yes, I need to.\" Immediately, Brandy drove him to the hospital. She couldn't go in with him, though, because they weren't accepting visitors. So, she sat in the car the entire evening and they texted back and forth. \"He updated me the whole time,\" she said.\n\nAt the hospital, Ben received oxygen and responded well, Brandy said. They gave him fluids and Tylenol and then sent him home that same evening. \"Keep doing what you're doing at home,\" they said.\n\nThe following Sunday, he was feeling better and showing signs of improvement, his wife said. He got out of bed and ate dinner for the first time.\n\n\"Sunday was a great day. He was up moving around, talking to us,\" Brandy said. Ben was on the road to recovery, it seemed. That night, however, his symptoms returned.\n\nBen and Brandy Luderer taught in the same New Jersey school district.\n\n\"Ben always said the nights had been the worst for him, he would sweat and when he laid down a certain way,\" Brandy said. \"It was particularly hard for him to breathe.\"\n\nThat night, Ben had an especially hard time getting comfortable. Because Ben was sleeping in the bedroom, and Brandy on the couch, they were texting back and forth to communicate. At one point, Ben texted his wife and said, \"I'm struggling.\" Brandy asked him if he needed to go back to the ER, and Ben replied that he wasn't sure.\n\n\"So, I just tried to do as much as I could to make him comfortable, you know, calm down his breathing, you know, get him to cool down,\" Brandy said. She borrowed a humidifier from a friend to try that.\n\nOnce Ben finally settled into bed, Brandy listened through the door of their bedroom.\n\n\"I could hear through the door that he was still breathing, and I fell asleep,\" she said. She checked in on him again at 2 a.m, and all seemed OK. However, when she woke at 6 a.m., she found her 30-year-old husband lifeless in their bed.\n\n\"Whether he knew you for five minutes or he knew you for his whole entire life, he would give you the same respect and try to reach out and help you and make you laugh in any way possible. That was just the type of selfless person he was,\" remembered Brandy.\n\nAs I listened to Brandy tell the story, my heart broke for her. They were husband and wife, but also best friends, both working in the same school district, driving to work every day. She didn't know what she would do with herself on Monday, let alone the rest of her life.\n\nAnd Brandy was left with a mystery. She knew her husband was sick, but how was it possible that a young, healthy 30-year-old with no pre-existing conditions declined so swiftly?\n\nBen Luderer's story is one of many that have perplexed health officials around the globe. Why is it that some young people are getting sick and dying so abruptly?\n\nIt is true that Covid-19 seems to most seriously affect older people, particularly those with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. It could be that an elderly person's immune systems may not be able to fight off the disease as well, and the virus can more easily replicate, overwhelming the body and causing multiple organ system failure.\n\nAnd yet, as we start to look deeper and hear more stories, it is becoming apparent there are many people like Ben, who are younger and still get very sick and die. I recently heard the story of 39-year-old Conrad Buchanan , a healthy, vivacious Florida DJ, who also died after having coronavirus despite having no underlying conditions, according to his wife.\n\nWe have known for some time that this new disease, Covid-19, was not only an older person's disease. It has become clear that the young and healthy are by no means immune to this infection and could become sick enough to require hospitalization.\n\nIn an early snapshot from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , for 2,449 patients whose age was known, 18% were between age 45 and 54, and 29% were between 20 and 44 years old. Among those who were hospitalized, 18% were ages 45 to 54 and 20% were ages 20 to 44.\n\nYounger people are far less likely to die, but there is an unusual pattern that seems to be emerging. As Dr. Anthony Fauci told me, it is what makes the coronavirus such an \"unusual disease.\"\n\n\"I'm fascinated,\" he said, \" ... by what I would call the pathogenesis.\"\n\n\"I mean, the dichotomy between that, there's something there, Sanjay, that we're missing from a pathogenesis standpoint. And I don't think it's only if you're elderly or if you have underlying conditions. There's something else going on there that hopefully we'll ultimately figure out.\"\n\nSo, what could be behind it? Scientists and researchers wonder if the answer could lie in our genes and are beginning to try and understand what differentiates people who get mild cases from those who die.\n\nOne possibility is a gene variation in the ACE2 gene. ACE2 is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, as well as the heart. In an article in Science magazine , Immunologist Dr. Philip Murphy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that \"variations in the ACE2 gene that alter the receptor could make it easier or harder for the virus to get into lung cells.\"\n\n\n\nIt is also possible that a critical ingredient produced by the body, known as surfactant, which better allows the lungs to expand and contract, becomes depleted in some patients infected with the coronavirus. If you think of your lungs as a sponge, surfactant would be the detergent which would make them soft and pliable. Without surfactant, however, your lung becomes stiff and hard to squeeze. It may be why some patients continue to struggle even on a breathing machine.\n\nAnother avenue being pursued is better understanding how your body's immune system responds to viruses and bacteria in the first place. In some young, healthy people, a very reactive immune system could lead to a massive inflammatory storm that could overwhelm the lungs and other organs. In those cases, it is not an aged or weakened immune system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well. Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.\n\nPerhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.\n\nTo better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age. While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people, like Ben and Conrad, we need to better understand.\n\nFor now, no matter your age or underlying condition, the advice remains the same. Stay home, wash your hands and reduce your virus exposure as much as possible. Even if you do develop mild symptoms, it is probably best to stay home to recover.\n\nBut if you develop trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in your chest, sudden confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face, please, it is time to go to the hospital.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBen Luderer's wife says doctors still can't explain exactly what happened.\n\n\"We don't really know,\" Brandy told us. \"I don't really know.\"\n\nFor now, all she can do is take things minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day to process how quickly her life changed.\n\n\"Ben and I were the type of couple that did everything together,\" she said. \"So, it's very hard understanding where to go with this when you don't have your partner in life that you did everything with. So, I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/05/health/young-people-dying-coronavirus-sanjay-gupta/index.html", "published": "2020-04-05T00:00:00"}]}, "corrieredellasera": {"rss": "http://xml2.corriereobjects.it/rss/homepage.xml", "link": "https://www.corriere.it/", "articles": [{"link": "https://www.corriere.it/caffe-gramellini/20_aprile_07/idiota-75e56aa8-7841-11ea-98b9-85d4a42f03ea.shtml", "published": "2020-04-07T08:18:10", "title": "Miranda Cafrae e la gara di Ironman da casa persa", "text": "Fateci uscire.

Arriva il primo esame del sangue tutto made in Italy, per verificare chi ha sviluppato gli anticorpi al Covid-19. Dopo sei settimane di studi condotti al Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia, la multinazionale di diagnostica DiaSorin \u00e8 pronta al lancio di un test sierologico costruito in vitro nei loro laboratori di Saluggia (Vercelli) da un team di 50 ricercatori. Entro due settimane \u00e8 attesa la certificazione Ce, poi potranno partire i test sulla popolazione (con un costo inferiore a 5 euro ciascuno). Il risultato arriva in un\u2019ora. In Italia potranno essere processati circa 500.000 campioni al giorno. La novit\u00e0 \u00e8 importante anche perch\u00e9 dal 1\u00b0 aprile la National Medical Products Administration (Nmpa), ossia la massima autorit\u00e0 del farmaco cinese, ha divulgato una nota ufficiale con la quale comunica che i test rapidi sierologici (basta una goccia di sangue ottenuta pungendo un dito con risultato in 15 minuti) non hanno ancora tutti ottenuto una certificazione di validit\u00e0 e sicurezza in Cina: vuol dire che i tanti kit che hanno inondato il mercato fino ad oggi, incluso quello italiano, non sono tutti in grado di indicare chi \u00e8 entrato in contatto con il virus, e quindi di escludere chi sia contagioso, perch\u00e9 hanno una bassa sensibilit\u00e0.\n\nCome funziona Il test italiano serve a rilevare chi, dopo aver contratto il virus ed essere considerato guarito perch\u00e9 i due tamponi a distanza di qualche giorno sono negativi, ha sviluppato quegli anticorpi che gli consentiranno di non ammalarsi di nuovo, in pratica certifica una patente di immunit\u00e0. L\u2019esame funziona come un normale prelievo ematico. I pochi microlitri di sangue vengono inseriti in un macchinario apposito in grado di metterli a contatto con la proteina sintetica costruita nei laboratori DiaSorin utilizzando un pezzo di Sars-Cov-2 (nome del virus). Il kit automatizzato verifica il legame fra la proteina e l\u2019anticorpo neutralizzante (quello che impedisce alla particella virale di replicarsi nella cellula umana) e lo evidenzia attraverso un segnale luminoso. Il prototipo \u00e8 stato testato nel laboratorio di virologia del San Matteo di Pavia utilizzando campioni di sangue (anonimi) di 150 pazienti ricoverati nelle varie fasi della malattia: terapia intensiva, malattie infettive, dimessi e guariti. La sperimentazione in vitro ha consentito di individuare la quantit\u00e0 di anticorpi prodotti dall\u2019organismo, e soprattutto quelli che lo proteggeranno in futuro: i neutralizzanti. Quanti di quei 22 mila cittadini considerati a oggi guariti, perch\u00e9 hanno fatto il secondo tampone risultato negativo, hanno sviluppato la patente di immunit\u00e0? In base ai risultati delle sperimentazioni eseguite nel laboratorio di virologia di Pavia guidato da Fausto Baldanti, si pu\u00f2 sapere solo con il test sierologico, valutato estremamente affidabile ed utilizzabile per lo studio epidemiologico di una intera popolazione, poich\u00e9 pu\u00f2 essere effettuato in tutti i punti prelievo di ogni ospedale. Ma quanto dura questa immunit\u00e0? Si capir\u00e0 ripetendo i test a distanza di mesi o anni.\n\nGli asintomatici La fase due dello screening riguarda invece quei milioni di cittadini che hanno contratto il Covid-19, ma non sono mai stati sottoposti al tampone perch\u00e9 asintomatici o con sintomi lievi. In questi soggetti il test rileva la quantit\u00e0 totale di anticorpi (che vengono prodotti in valori diversi fra i 7 e 14 giorni dopo aver contratto l\u2019infezione). Se sono presenti gli anticorpi \u00abkiller\u00bb permette di considerare queste persone immuni, ma non esclude (con le conoscenze attuali) la loro potenziale infettivit\u00e0, che pu\u00f2 essere accertata soltanto con due tamponi nasali. Una strategia per\u00f2 non applicabile sui grandi numeri per carenza mondiale di reagenti. La soluzione realisticamente praticabile sarebbe quella di evitare il secondo tampone finale in quei soggetti in cui si \u00e8 riscontrata una negativit\u00e0 nel primo, contestualmente a una alta presenza di anticorpi neutralizzanti. Si tratta di persone che stanno bene, ma alle quali sarebbe per prudenza consigliabile restare a casa per 7 giorni. Se, invece, saranno reimmesse nei circuiti lavorativi, altrettanto prudentemente e sempre per una settimana, occorrer\u00e0 garantire l\u2019obbligo inderogabile della mascherina e il mantenimento del distanziamento sociale."}, {"link": "https://www.corriere.it/politica/20_aprile_07/coronavirus-l-inizio-fase-2-4-maggio-data-cruciale-ma-divieto-assembramento-1102d142-7847-11ea-98b9-85d4a42f03ea.shtml", "published": "2020-04-07T06:56:52", "title": "Coronavirus, per la fase 2 il 4 maggio \u00e8 la data cruciale.

Utah has 1,255. I mean, are these not states that you think should have those stay-at-home orders in place? THE PRESIDENT: No, I think they\u2019re doing a great job. Well, that\u2019s a very small number relative to population. Q It\u2019s larger than some states that do have stay-at -home orders that are already in place. THE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s up to the \u2014 if I saw something wrong, I saw a massive breakout \u2014 of which that\u2019s not \u2014 I would come down very hard. But \u2014 Q Isn\u2019t the key in this pandemic getting ahead of those numbers, though? THE PRESIDENT: No, not in that case. But in the case \u2014 I know the states you\u2019re talking about. By the way, I think you\u2019re up to 92 percent is covered. Ninety-two percent of the country is covered. And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference.

But to say that it started on the left and to say that it started in the media really are one and the same.\u201d\n\nNews media would conduct themselves differently with a Democrat president, estimated Pollak.\n\nPollak continued, \u201cOne thing that would not be happening if a Democrat was president is that you would not see the media trying to pick apart everything that the president was doing. You would not see them criticizing everything the president said. You would not see them asking questions in the briefing room, constantly trying to assign blame to the president. You would not see them making up fake news, or reporting statements out of context, or trying to frighten the public. You would not see them looking backward in the middle of a crisis and asking what the president could have done to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would have seen [news media] rallying the public around the Democratic president,\u201d Pollak added. \u201cYou would have seen them calling for patriotism. You would have seen them highlighting survivors. You would have seen them interviewing healthcare workers, and truckers, and grocers, and farmers. You would have seen them lamenting the fact that their wonderful Democratic president \u2014 whoever it would be, Obama or someone else \u2014 had to have their legacy challenged, had to be faced with such a crisis when they were doing so well up until now.\u201d\n\nPollak went on, \u201cAnd you would have seen them calling the country to unite under the flag and move forward. We would have seen the media pushing for national unity around the president, even in an election year and, perhaps for a Democratic president, especially in an election year.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nPollak observed, \u201cWe do not see the media rallying the country. We see them trying to tear the country apart, and they\u2019re taking the natural political instinct on both right and left, which is to keep doing what they were doing before, and the media are stoking those fires. It\u2019s been long enough, now \u2014 it\u2019s been several weeks, now \u2014 of watching this unfold.\u201d\n\n\u201cAside from some of the speeches by the president and the occasional words of some business leaders who\u2019ve stepped forward to offer their help to the president even though they may not support him politically, there have been so few moments of national unity,\u201d noted Pollak.\n\nDemocrats and news media mirror one another\u2019s attitude towards President Donald Trump, Pollak said.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden did not offer his support to the president after he addressed the nation from the Oval Office,\u201d Pollak recalled. \u201cNeither did Bernie Sanders. Nancy Pelosi made a speech televised nationwide in which she did not even mention the president.\u201d\n\nPollak went on, \u201cFor weeks, none of the Democratic leaders would even acknowledge that [Donald Trump] was leading the country in the middle of a crisis. The media stoked that, and the media pushed the idea \u2014 deliberately \u2014 that the president was not to be trusted and that the highest duty was either to remove him from office somehow or, effectively, to put somebody else in charge. In fact, they\u2019re still pushing that idea. They still refuse to hear what he has to say. They still believe that somebody else should be in charge of making the decisions and speaking to the nation.\u201d\n\nPollak predicted, \u201cWe will not be proud of how our political class has dealt with the threat of the coronavirus because they were, as a whole, unprepared on both sides. We will be even less proud of how they\u2019ve dealt with the response, how they\u2019ve encouraged us \u2014 through the media \u2014 to tear each other apart. The heroes in the fight against the coronavirus are the workers, the truckers, the people out there in the hospitals making a difference, and it\u2019s you and I who are going to have to be those heroes and support those heroes, but our political class as a whole has failed us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say that had a Democratic president been in office when this happened, the same thing would have happened because I don\u2019t think any administration would have been ready for this,\u201d Pollak stated. \u201cPerhaps the Democratic administration would not have imposed to travel ban. That was Trump\u2019s instinct. Perhaps the Democratic administration would have had a few more officials in the government with titles and responsibilities to look after this. That\u2019s the Democratic instinct to have more people in government assigned with more duties and so forth, but I think this is the kind of disaster that overwhelms any government, and the only thing you can do is respond.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are more inclined to offer support to Democrat presidents in times of crisis than Democrats, determined Pollak.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that had a Democratic president been in office that you would find some Republicans \u2014 given the nature of our country \u2014 sniping at the Democratic president the way that some Democrats have been sniping at our president,\u201d Pollak remarked. \u201cI think it would have been fewer. I think that you would have seen Republicans rally around even a Democratic president the same way that Republicans rallied around Obama when he took out Osama bin Laden, the same way many Republicans even rallied around Obama when he went to war in Libya. There is an innate Republican instinct to side with a commander-in-chief, to side with the military, but there still would have been some sniping, I grant that.\u201d\n\nPollak lamented, \u201cBipartisanship is unfortunately in short supply, and there\u2019s no political party that wastes an opportunity to score points at the other\u2019s expense, even at times [of crisis], unfortunately at the expense of the national interest.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Sunday broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/04/06/joel-pollak-if-a-democrat-were-president-media-would-push-unity-against-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-04-06T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Dem Leader of Armed Services Panel Calls for Navy Secretary's Firing", "text": "House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-WA) called for the removal of Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly on Monday because of his decision to fire Navy Capt.
